hi
this template gives you an idea on how to create an online game in ngt
features:
A 3D map is available
Player data x,y,z and map are saved, see server>includes>charsave.ngt file for detailed information.
known problems
The following problems may be related to the engine because I have not found a fix yet.
Most of the time the map does not load completely.
If you do not close the game completely when you are offline and do not open it, you cannot log in again.
These problems will be solved when the developer makes the necessary corrections in the engine.
Feel free to contact me for different problems
