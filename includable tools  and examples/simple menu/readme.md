This menu was made with reference to the dynamic menu in BGT.

This menu supports speech and audio playback from file. Additionally, if you want, you can use both speaking and audio playback functions at the same time.
If both speech and audio playback are to be added at the same time, the menu item and the audio file must be the same for now. This will change soon.
see test.ngt for example
